      This is a group project by <strong>Raghad</strong> & <strong>Najwa</strong>, as part of our studies at 
      <a href="https://tuwaiq.edu.sa/holberton">Holberton School by Tuwaiq Academy</a>. It focuses on implementing and manipulating <strong>binary trees</strong> using the C programming language.
      We explored the creation of binary tree nodes, insertion (left/right), traversals, and property checks
      such as height, depth, and balance.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Skills gained:</strong> memory allocation, recursion, data structure implementation,
      tree traversals, and pointer management.

      A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left and right child. It is used in various applications such as searching, sorting, and expression parsing.

|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| ![binary_trees.h](https://img.shields.io/badge/-binary_trees.h-blueviolet) | Header file defining the binary tree node struct, typedefs, and all function prototypes for tree operations like creation, insertion, traversal, deletion, and property checks. |
| ![0-binary_tree_node.c](https://img.shields.io/badge/-0--binary_tree_node.c-blue)          | Implements creation of a new binary tree node. Allocates memory, initializes node's value, parent pointer, and sets left and right children to NULL. |
| ![1-binary_tree_insert_left.c](https://img.shields.io/badge/-1--binary_tree_insert_left.c-green) | Inserts a new node as the left child of a given parent node. Handles existing left child by shifting it to be left child of the new node. |
| ![2-binary_tree_insert_right.c](https://img.shields.io/badge/-2--binary_tree_insert_right.c-yellow) | Inserts a new node as the right child of a given parent node. Manages existing right child similarly by re-linking it to the new node. |
| ![3-binary_tree_delete.c](https://img.shields.io/badge/-3--binary_tree_delete.c-red)       | Recursively deletes a whole binary tree from any node. Frees all allocated memory to avoid leaks. |
| ![4-binary_tree_is_leaf.c](https://img.shields.io/badge/-4--binary_tree_is_leaf.c-orange)  | Checks if a given node is a leaf node (i.e., has no children). Returns 1 if leaf, else 0. |
| ![5-binary_tree_is_root.c](https://img.shields.io/badge/-5--binary_tree_is_root.c-lightgrey) | Determines if a node is the root by checking if its parent is NULL. |
| ![6-binary_tree_preorder.c](https://img.shields.io/badge/-6--binary_tree_preorder.c-purple) | Performs preorder traversal of the tree (node -> left -> right) and applies a user-provided function to each node's value. |
| ![7-binary_tree_inorder.c](https://img.shields.io/badge/-7--binary_tree_inorder.c-pink)     | Performs inorder traversal (left -> node -> right) on the binary tree, calling a function on each node's value. |
| ![8-binary_tree_postorder.c](https://img.shields.io/badge/-8--binary_tree_postorder.c-cyan) | Performs postorder traversal (left -> right -> node), invoking a function on each node's value. |
| ![9-binary_tree_height.c](https://img.shields.io/badge/-9--binary_tree_height.c-lightblue)   | Calculates the height of the tree: the longest path from the node down to a leaf (number of edges). |
| ![10-binary_tree_depth.c](https://img.shields.io/badge/-10--binary_tree_depth.c-lightgreen)  | Calculates the depth of a node: the number of edges from the node up to the root. |
| ![11-binary_tree_size.c](https://img.shields.io/badge/-11--binary_tree_size.c-lightyellow)  | Computes the total number of nodes in the binary tree starting from a given node recursively. |
| ![12-binary_tree_leaves.c](https://img.shields.io/badge/-12--binary_tree_leaves.c-lightcoral) | Counts how many leaf nodes (nodes without children) exist in the tree. |
| ![13-binary_tree_nodes.c](https://img.shields.io/badge/-13--binary_tree_nodes.c-lightpink)  | Counts all nodes in the tree that have at least one child (internal nodes). |
| ![14-binary_tree_balance.c](https://img.shields.io/badge/-14--binary_tree_balance.c-lightgray) | Calculates the balance factor of a node, defined as height(left subtree) - height(right subtree). Useful for balanced tree checks. |
| ![15-binary_tree_is_full.c](https://img.shields.io/badge/-15--binary_tree_is_full.c-lightsteelblue) | Checks if the binary tree is full, meaning every node has either 0 or 2 children. Returns 1 if full, else 0. |
| ![16-binary_tree_is_perfect.c](https://img.shields.io/badge/-16--binary_tree_is_perfect.c-lightseagreen) | Determines if the tree is perfect: all internal nodes have two children and all leaves are at the same depth. |
| ![17-binary_tree_sibling.c](https://img.shields.io/badge/-17--binary_tree_sibling.c-lightsalmon) | Finds the sibling of a given node, i.e., the other child of the node's parent. Returns NULL if none. |
| ![18-binary_tree_uncle.c](https://img.shields.io/badge/-18--binary_tree_uncle.c-lightgoldenrodyellow) | Finds the uncle of a node, defined as the sibling of the nodeâ€™s parent. |
| ![0-main.c](https://img.shields.io/badge/-0--main.c-lightcyan)                               | Main driver file that builds a sample binary tree using the above functions and prints it. Serves as test and demonstration code. |

## Installation & Compilation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RaghadAlbeladi1/holbertonschool-binary_trees.git
cd holbertonschool-binary_trees
````
Compile and test one task (example: task 0)

  binary_tree_print.c 0-binary_tree_node.c 0-main.c -o 0-node
````
Run
````

````
## Examples
To use any of the implemented binary tree functions, include the header file binary_trees.h in your C code and compile it with the required .c source files.
````
#include "binary_trees.h"

int main(void) {
    /* Your code here */
    return 0;
}
````
### Testing
To use any implemented binary tree function, include the header file `binary_trees.h` and write your main program like this:

```c
#include "binary_trees.h"

int main(void)
{
    binary_tree_t *root;

    root = binary_tree_node(NULL, 98);
    root->left = binary_tree_node(root, 12);
    root->right = binary_tree_node(root, 402);

    binary_tree_print(root);

    binary_tree_delete(root);

    return (0);
}
```
